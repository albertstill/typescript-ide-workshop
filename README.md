An iffy repo that will be improved via VSCode TypeScript features https://code.visualstudio.co  xm/docs/languages/typescript.
 
To demo

- go to definition
- finding references
- rename times to multiply
- refactor to another file
- refactor to destructured object
- call hierarchy
- const mess around in addAndMultiply
- auto import
- convert to async function
